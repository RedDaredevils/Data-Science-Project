1. Import Libraries
Key libraries like pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, and various machine learning tools are used for data handling, visualization, and modeling.

2. Data Visualization
A pairplot is generated to explore the relationships between features (e.g., house size, income, crime rate) and the target variable, house price. This gives a visual understanding of data trends and potential correlations.

3. Correlation Analysis
A heatmap displays correlations between all variables, identifying how strongly each feature relates to others and to house price.

4. Checking Multicollinearity
Variance Inflation Factor (VIF) is calculated to detect multicollinearity. Low VIF values across features indicate no severe multicollinearity issues.

5. Data Splitting and Training
The dataset is divided into training and testing sets. A linear regression model is trained, and its coefficients are printed to interpret feature importance.

6. Prediction
A sample data point is used to predict house price, showcasing the model's real-world applicability.

7. Model Evaluation
Metrics such as R², MAE, MSE, and RMSE are calculated to assess the model's performance. An R² score close to 1 indicates excellent model fit.

8. Model Accuracy
The model achieves a 92.74% accuracy, derived using Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE). This confirms the model's reliability in predictions.

9. Hyperparameter Tuning
Various algorithms like Ridge, Lasso, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, XGBoost, and SVR are tested using GridSearchCV to identify the best model and hyperparameters.

Results:
Linear Regression performs best with the lowest test MSE (0.011) and the highest R² (≈1.0).
Final accuracy of 99.81% is achieved using Linear Regression.
Conclusion
This approach showcases the power of regression and the importance of evaluating multiple models for predicting house prices. The detailed steps ensure scalability and adaptability for similar datasets or problems.
