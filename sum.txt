Project Submission: Predicting House Prices Using Multiple Regression
1.Introduction

Problem Statement: The objective of this project is to build a regression model that can predict house prices based on various features (e.g., size, location, number of bedrooms).

Business Relevance: Predicting house prices is a common task in the real estate industry. Accurate predictions can help real estate agents, buyers, and sellers make informed decisions.

2. Dataset Description

Source: Simulated dataset for regression analysis.

Features:
- Size of the House (in square feet)
- Number of Bedrooms
- Location (City/Region)
- Year Built

Target Variable: House Price (dependent variable)

Data Preprocessing:
- Data cleaned and handled for missing values.
- Features normalized/scaled if needed.
- Data split into training and testing sets.
3. Model Evaluation

Model Used: Multiple Linear Regression

Why Chosen: Multiple Linear Regression was chosen to predict house prices because it allows us to model the relationship between the target variable (house price) and multiple independent variables.

Evaluation Metrics:
- R² Score: 0.973
- Mean Absolute Error (MAE): $40,169.09
- Mean Squared Error (MSE): 2,317,970,141.92
- Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE): $48,145.30

Interpretation of Results:
- The R² score indicates that the model explains 97.3% of the variance in house prices.
- The MAE, MSE, and RMSE highlight the average prediction error, with an MAE of $40,169 indicating that the model's predictions are, on average, this much off from actual values.

4. Model Improvements (Optional)

Potential improvements for future work include:
- Feature Engineering: Adding more features, such as the age of the house, neighborhood characteristics, or market trends.

- Model Tuning: Trying different algorithms like Random Forest or Gradient Boosting to see if they perform better.

- Hyperparameter Tuning: Performing hyperparameter optimization using Grid Search or Randomized Search.

5. Conclusion
The Multiple Linear Regression model has provided a strong starting point for predicting house prices, with a high R² score and a reasonable prediction error (MAE). The next steps involve testing more complex models and tuning the existing model for even better performance.
